              It all started with three friends with inspiration from Apes.
              Tarzan is heavily involved with business as an entrepreneur, who
              loves to collect classic cars and NFTs. Achila is an artist who
              brings art to life with her amazing talents. Karry is a blockchain
              expert who writes gibberish codes on his computer. We donâ€™t
              understand it, not even a tiny byte of it, but it somehow
              magically works. All are greatly interested in NFTs and their
              lore. They combined their powers to bring this collection to life.
